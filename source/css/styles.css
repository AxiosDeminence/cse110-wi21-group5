/* Some things to consider while working on this document:

 * Header and footer's styling will be very similar, almost identical in v1

 * The "timer ring" styling will mostly be controlled by timer.js - don't worry about it too much here

 * Make sure that this page will always take up the full height and width of the viewport (i.e. the device you are viewing the page on) - you may need to do some research into something called "responsive web design".
