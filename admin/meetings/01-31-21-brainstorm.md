# Brainstorm Meeting #2

### Attendance and Time
Absent: None 

Held on zoom at 8:00PM PST

END: 8:30 PM

## Rough Project Outline

1. home page will show all tasks and have "new task" and "menu" button, the latter being discreet
2. when click on a task, have a progress bar showing on top how many pomodoro sessions are there total and a big tomato that is the timer
3. analysis of data? still not sure what that does exactly, SAVE FOR WEEK 6+
4. Assume that the tasks are not done back to back (meaning that 4 consecutive pomodoros across 2 tasks will not get a break)
5. Fun idea: cut tomato to break pomodoro, (OR just have a pause/exit feature during a pomodoro)

### Ideas
- Only show the log history button during the long break maybe
- Option to view log button during break time
