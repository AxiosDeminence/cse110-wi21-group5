Held on zoom at 9:30
### Advice
- Work on documentation of our progress
- Pay attention not just to the software and product, but also the process
- usability, usefulness, and software engineer process
- Think of other processes (compressing image assets)
- write our team goals and the dividing of tasks, upload that to slack
