#### Total of 30 points going for week 8 and 9
## Problems
- Testing is a bit late compare to other features

# Next steps
- Focus on testing 
- CSS styling fine tune for different sizes of windows
- Play more with our app and try to break it / find more bugs

## Current Features Fine Tune
- Options Menu should disable invalid inputs; it should also display a message telling the user they save the setting successfully
- Task list is now hooked up with our timer and this feature is not robust enough. Need to improve.
