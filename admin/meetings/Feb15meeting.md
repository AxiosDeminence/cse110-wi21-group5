# Group Meeting

### Attendance and Time
Absent: Yunha and Malcolm

## Discussion
- Reviewed v1 of the project 
- Clarification: start button would become the stop button ( vs reset?) vs a way to kill the timer
- timer still runs when pressing the log button 
- local storage to add tasks
- custom times
- Should we have the option to add tasks during our break?
- What if we click the second project after not finishing first?
- maybe add a checkbox
- left of the task is the checkbox for the user's personal book keeping

# Team Meeting with TA

Held on zoom at 9:30
### Advice
- Look at A11y - accessibility 
- 2 people take up the time and make the performance/animations nicer
#### Usability, Usefulness, Code hygiene 
- adding classes or a google calender integration - description ( tasks that you ticked off)
- Create a link with the app at some point
- Check if the code is well documented, well tested
- Do you feel like using it?
- Suggestion: side by side table log
