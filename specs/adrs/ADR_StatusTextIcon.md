## Replace status text with illuatrative icons !



### Reasons:

- Malcolm: Use colors and shapes to illustrate our current status in Pomodoro timer - Icons!
- Rui: Is it clearer to have the "work", "shortbreak" string side by side with the icons?



### Outcomes:

- (+) Use icons entirely to illustrate current status
- (+) We already have these icons inside our info page, so users would know about them.
- (-) Users might need to click into our info page to actually understand what icons represent.
