## Simplify the log function



### Reasons:

- Already at the end of quarter, should focus more on fine-tuning existing features
- Malcolm: It's gonna require a lot of work to get it functioning as expected, which is valuable time that could be spent fine-tuning existing features and improving accessibility. It's quite complex and could create a lot of bugs at a late stage in development. If you guys want to keep it, I'm definitely willing to implement it, but it will pretty much be the last thing I will have time to do for this project.
- Rui Cai: I think we should definitely implement it. I believe this feature is what’s special about our project and what makes our project stands out. In terms of actual implementation, I think we can simplify it. 





### Outcomes:

- (+) We can use the same logic as our task list:
    1. add a button to display / close the list (so we give up the idea of the log list showing up automatically during long break);
    2. the log list can take smaller space on the right of the timer ring so we don’t need to change the layout and therefore no animation needed

    I believe making the two changes above should basically make the log function pretty much the same as our task list, and would make it a lot easier to implement
