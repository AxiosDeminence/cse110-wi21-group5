## Keep only five log messages in app



### Reasons:

- Get confused about how many log messages we need to keep track of and display



### Outcomes:

- (+) We keep track of only the five most recently added log messages
- (+) This is easier to manage and implement: no need for a scrollable list
- (+) Local storage won't blow up because of many messages
- (-) Users might expect to see more log messages....
