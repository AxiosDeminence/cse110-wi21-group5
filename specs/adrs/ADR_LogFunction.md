## Inclusion of Log Function



### Reasons:

- To be more closely in line with the original purpose of the Pomodoro timer

- Gives users a recap of their efficiency during work sessions

- Use this log function instead of a stop function: user cannot stop the timer, but they can log what distracts them during a working session.


### Outcomes:

- (+) gives user ability to reflect on distractions

- (-) might become a distraction itself while logging
