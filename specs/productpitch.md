# 1. Problem/Statement of Purpose 
### The raw idea, a use case, or something we’ve seen that motivates us to work on this 

The pomodoro technique is a simple but effective way to improve productivity. It motivates people to divide their work into manageable pieces and concentrate on them. A physical pomodoro timer is the easiest way to facilitate the pomodoro technique.
We aim to develop a web app that mimics a physical pomodoro timer, while adding features (such as session logging and task tracking) that would help users adapt to the pomodoro technique quicker. Meanwhile, we plan to accomplish that without taking away the simplicity of a physical pomodoro timer.
 
# 2. User personas
#### College student: 
As a college student looking to improve my productivity while working on tasks, I want to have an interface for me to keep track of the tasks that I have completed. I would like the product to be intuitive to use, allowing me to organize tasks, and track how my ability to concentrate improves over time.
#### Entrepreneur: 
As an entrepreneur, I use my phone extensively, which has taken away a lot of my concentration. I wish the product can help manage my time and minimize procrastination.
#### Creative Writer: 
As a hobbyist creative writer looking to structure my writing process, I want to have a pomodoro app that has relatively flexible pomo sessions and helps aid my creative processes. I wish to prevent short-term burnouts by using the pomodoro timer, and I would like customizable pomo session lengths. Also, audio indications would also be useful for me.


# 3. Appetite 
#### How much time we want to spend and how that constrains the solution
(I think this part is optional)


 
# 4. Solution 
### The core elements we came up with, presented in a form that’s easy for people to immediately understand 

Given the time constraints of this course, we plan to develop the pomodoro web app in an iterative manner, meaning we would build the core functionality of the app first, then incrementally adding other features in an order of decreased importance. 
We came up with 3 versions of the pomodoro app, listed below in increasing complexity

V1: Barebone app, only enabling start, stop, and reset.
